                <p id='c-align-body'>Let's have a look at the crime rate in Victoria over the past 10 years (2012-2021).
                    Due to the large variation in population between each Local Govenment Area (LGA), we'll normalise
                    the
                    rate of offences by the population. Let's compare the rate of offences in <span class='metro'>Metro
                        Victoria</span>
                    and <span class="regional">Regional Victoria.<br><br><br><br></span>


                <p id='c-align-body'>From the scatter plot on the right, we can see no clear separation of data points
                    from
                    <span class='metro'>Metro Victoria</span> and <span class="regional">Regional Victoria</span> ;
                    rather, all the data points
                    are mixed with each other. This would indicate that <span class='metro'>Metro Victoria</span>
                    and <span class="regional">Regional Victoria</span> are very similar in terms of overall safety.<br><br><br><br>
                </p>


                <p id='c-align-body'>The <span class='bluetext'>blue</span> line is the average rate of offences per
                    100,000 residents of
                    every LGA in that particular year. On the both graph, we can see more clearly that there has been a
                    steady rise in the
                    average number of offences over the past decade. <br><br><br><br></p>
                </p>

                <p id='c-align-body'>It would be interesting to discuss why there was a sudden spike in the average
                    offence rate in 2016.<br><br><br><br></p>

                <p id='c-align-subtitle'><br><br><br><br>Another interesting point to discuss would be the following; are
                    different subcategories of crimes correlated? That is, are LGAs with a high rate of "Crime against the person",
                    which includes offences such as assault and homicide, more prone to having higher rate of "Drug offences"?
                    The Victorian Police categorizes all offences into 6 categories. Let's have a look at their relationships with 
                    this scatterplot matrix below. Note we are just using 2021 data here.<br><br></p>

            <div class="pure-u-1-1">
                <p id='c-align-subtitle'><br><br><br><br>We can see that there does seem to be a positive correlation between all types of offences,
                    especially drug offences seemingly being a positive factor influence on the rate of other offences. The category of 'other offences'
                    seems to not have a strong relationship with other subcategories of offences. An interesting note is here, datapoints of 
                    <span class='metro'> Metro Victoria</span> and <span class='regional'> Regional Victoria</span> seem to have more separation.
                    For example, we can see that <span class='metro'> Metro Victoria</span> has an overall higher "Drug offence" rate, whilst 
                    <span class='regional'> Regional Victoria</span> has an higher average "Justice procedure offences".
